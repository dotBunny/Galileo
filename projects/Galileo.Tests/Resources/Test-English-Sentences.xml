<!-- Poems of William Wordsworth, 1770 - 1850 -->
<lines>
  From low to high doth dissolution climb,
  And sink from high to low, along a scale
  Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;
  A musical but melancholy chime,
  Which they can hear who meddle not with crime,
  Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care.
  Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear
  The longest date do melt like frosty rime,
  That in the morning whitened hill and plain
  And is no more; drop like the tower sublime
  Of yesterday, which royally did wear
  His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain
  Some casual shout that broke the silent air,
  Or the unimaginable touch of Time.
  Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
  To pace the ground, if path be there or none,
  While a fair region round the traveller lies
  Which he forbears again to look upon;
  Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,
  The work of Fancy, or some happy tone
  Of meditation, slipping in between
  The beauty coming and the beauty gone.
  If Thought and Love desert us from that day,
  Let us break off all commerce with the Muse:
  With Thought and Love companions of our way,
  Whate’er the senses take or may refuse,
  The Mind’s internal heaven shall shed her dews
  Of inspiration on the humblest lay.
  When haughty expectations prostrate lie,
  And grandeur crouches like a guilty thing,
  Oft shall the lowly weak, till nature bring
  Mature release, in fair society
  Survive, and Fortune’s utmost anger try;
  Like these frail snow-drops that together cling,
  And nod their helmets smitten by the wing
  Of many a furious whirlblast sweeping by.
  Observe the faithful flowers! if small to great
  May lead the thoughts, thus struggling used to stand
  The Emathian phalanx, nobly obstinate;
  And so the bright immortal Theban band,
  Whom onset, fiercely urged at Jove’s command,
  Might overwhelm, but could not separate!
  The world is too much with us; late and soon,
  Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;
  Little we see in Nature that is ours;
  We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
  This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
  The winds that will be howling at all hours,
  And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,
  For this, for everything, we are out of tune;
  It moves us not.—Great God!  I’d rather be
  A pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
  So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
  Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
  Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
  Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn
  It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
  The holy time is quiet as a Nun
  Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
  Is sinking down in its tranquility;
  The gentleness of heaven broods o’er the Sea;
  Listen! the mighty Being is awake,
  And doth with his eternal motion make
  A sound like thunder—everlastingly.
  Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,
  If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,
  Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
  Thou liest in Abraham’s bosom all the year;
  And worshipp’st at the Temple’s inner shrine,
  God being with thee when we know it not.
